# Anomalous Network Activity Detector with Machine Learning - Tommaso Pastorelli - 2024/25

## Description
Anomalous Network Activity Detector with Machine Learning is a project aimed at monitoring network data and so identifying unusual patterns in network traffic using machine learning techniques. The goal is to enhance network security by detecting potential threats in real-time.

## University/Scholastic Scope
This project is part of a university curriculum for the academic year 2024/25. It is designed to demonstrate the practical application of machine learning in cybersecurity, particularly in identifying and mitigating network threats.

## Methods of Attack/Injection
The project focuses on detecting various types of network attacks, including but not limited to:
- **IP Spoofing:** Creating IP packets with a forged source IP address to impersonate another system.
- **Port Scanning:** Systematically scanning a computer's ports to find vulnerabilities.
- **Packet Flooding:** Overwhelming a network with excessive packets to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Oversized Packets:** Sending packets that exceed the maximum transmission unit (MTU) to cause fragmentation and potential buffer overflow.
- **Fragmented Packets:** Breaking packets into smaller pieces to bypass security measures.
- **Malformed Packets:** Sending packets with incorrect header information to confuse or crash the recipient system.
- **Protocol Anomalies:** Exploiting deviations from standard protocol behaviors to identify or exploit vulnerabilities.

## Tools Used
- **Scapy:** A Python library used to forge, decode, and analyze network packets.
- **PyShark:** A Python wrapper for tshark, allowing packet analysis using Wireshark's capabilities.
- **Wireshark:** A network protocol analyzer used to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.

## Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification
The project will use and test various machine learning algorithms to classify network activity as normal or anomalous. These include:
- **Classification Trees:** A supervised learning algorithm used for classification and is also used in random forests.
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method for classification that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A simple, instance-based learning algorithm for classification and regression.
- **Neural Networks:** A set of algorithms modeled after the human brain that are designed to recognize patterns.

## Testing and Evaluation
The effectiveness of these algorithms will be evaluated using:
- **Accuracy:** The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Precision and Recall:** Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives, while recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all the observations in the actual class.
- **F1 Score:** The weighted average of precision and recall, which considers both false positives and false negatives.

## Project Status
This project is still under development. Usage and installation instructions will be provided once the project is complete.
